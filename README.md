## Task

The task is to create a simple calendar application from scratch. To reduce the implementation time, please make use of Angular Material and the Angular CDK (donâ€™t use any other libraries).

The styling of the application is not the most important.

The calendar app should consist of:

- form to add a calendar appointment
- ability to delete the appointment
- ability to move the appointment
- use Date() to work with time/date
- implement mouse Drag&Drop using Angular CDK
- ngFor to render calendar dates and appointments (calendar view)
- lazy-load
- rxjs
